# 🃏 UI Card List with Dark Mode Toggle 🌙

This project is a simple UI card list that displays descriptions of different people. It has:
- An **Add** button at the top to add new cards.
- A **Delete** button on each card that moves the card to the bottom of the list when clicked.
- A **Dark Mode** toggle switch that lets you switch between light and dark themes. It saves your theme preference so the next time you visit the page, it remembers your choice!

## 🚀 Features

- **Add New Card**: Click the "Add" button to add the previous delted card to the list.
- **Delete Card**: Each card has a "Delete" button. When clicked, the card is removed from the screen.
- **Dark Mode**: You can switch between dark and light mode using a toggle. The best part is, it remembers your theme using `localStorage` so you don’t have to switch it every time you reload the page!
- **Responsive**: The website looks good on both mobile and desktop.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **HTML**: To build the structure of the page and the cards.
- **SCSS**: For stylish and neat design.
- **JavaScript**: To add interactivity, like adding/removing cards and toggling dark mode.
- **LocalStorage**: To save the dark mode setting across page reloads.
